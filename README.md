# Recommendation-system-based-on-Nonnegative-Matrix-Factorization

## Goal:
 To recommend the movies that user might want to watch.
### Recommender systems
- Recommender systems aim to predict usersâ€™ interests and recommend product items that quite likely are interesting for them. They are among the most powerful machine learning systems that online retailers implement in order to drive sales.

- Data required for recommender systems stems from explicit user ratings after watching a movie or listening to a song, from implicit search engine queries and purchase histories, or from other knowledge about the users/items themselves.
Examples of Recommendation systems are Netflix or YouTube that suggest playlists or make video recommendations 

## Types of recommender systems:
- Content-based systems, which use characteristic information.

- Collaborative filtering systems, which are based on user-item interactions.

- Hybrid systems, which combine both types of information with the aim of avoiding problems that are generated when working with just one kind.

## Dataset
Movie lens Dataset consists of :b100000 ratings (1 lakh) , 600 users

## Matrix factorization
-  R (users,movies) 
-  U (users,d)
-  VT (d,movies)
-  here d is number of latent features 
## Prediction of rating of movies using gradient descent algorithm.

### Gradient descent
  Optimization techniques used in Gradient descent
  - Regularized Gradient descent
  - Sliding Window Gradient descent
  - Line Search Gradient descent
  - Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) Gradient descent
